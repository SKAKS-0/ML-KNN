# ML-KNN
Python ML code using KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) Algorithm 

The code does the following:
 1. Reads file containing the dataset
 2. Converts nonnumerical data into numerical values (encoding)
 3. Divides dataset into training and testing datasets
 4. Creates model
 5. Tests model
 6. Uses model to predict
